- 👋 Hi, I’m @shortross27. Currently living in San Diego, CA with my beautiful wife and baby girl. My career right now is electrical which I enjoy but it will eventually take a toll on my body so I am pursuing a different career. I am taking online courses at the University of Maryland Global Campus majoring in computer studies. I listen to as many podcast and audible books about data science that I can find in my pursuit to enter the field. I am also self teaching Python and hoping to learn all the skills listed in my interest below. Many people I have heard talk about data science recommend building an online presence and building a portfolio for future job offers. I am very excited to start this journey and hopefully meet some incredible people in this community! 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Data Science, Machine Learning, R, SQL, Tensor Flow, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, Computer Science, Electrical Theory
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... skills to pursue Data Science, starting a data science project.
